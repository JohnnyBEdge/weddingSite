                <h4>His Story</h4>
                <p>My earliest memory of Sarah is from our university's rock climbing tower. My friend and I went back and forth about which employee at the tower was the best looking and my vote was with Sarah. After becoming one of the regulars, we got to know each other by name and had occasional conversations. When I returned from a summer in Vietnam and learned she had just returned from a trip to India, we shared our stories and my interests grew. </p>
                <p>Our first date was to an Indian temple where they only accepted cash. With my hatred of U-turns and chosen path, we ended up at the temple without ever passing an ATM which meant she was paying. Now she's checking off boxes left and right: she climbs, she travels, she likes indian food and pays for dates, she passed the "door test" (A Bronx Tale), was not only good looking, but had a brain to match, and most importantly, she was learning to skateboard. 
                </p>
                <p>It was scary how much I started to like this girl. I had dated throughout my college days, but never had anything serious come from them. Since I had to retake some courses, my collge career was prolonged and it was during this time I finally worked up the courage to ask her to be in an official relationship... to which she said no... and then followed it with our first kiss. Confused? Yes! Happy? Yes! Her "boyfriend"? Not for another 3 months until she introduced me to her family and friends back home!</p>
                <p>Sarah has always supported me and my dreams. She has shown me a lot about myself I never knew and has been right by my side through some tougher moments in my life. And for all that, I want to spend the rest of my life trying to repay her.  </p>

                <h4>Her Story</h4>
                <p>John first caught my eye at the UCF rock climbing tower. One summer day I was working and John showed up in a bright red shirt with the Vietnamese star in the middle, which sparked a conversation where we exchanged travel stories from Vietnam and India. After that day, my interests were up! We were friends for a few months, he would bring ginger chews to the tower for me, which I hated at first but ate because I wanted to impress him. </p> <p>After a couple months of friendly hang outs and climbing together I was wondering if it was a one sided interest. On his birthday I made him a homemade ice cream cake, his favorite flavor, drove him home and waited patiently for a more than friendly goodbye. Turns out, I got a one armed hug and a wave. Next was Halloween, I reluctantly agreed to watch a scary movie with John. Naturally, John decided to hide and scare me after the movie! Rude… That next week John asked to come over after a long evening of studying in the library, when he got to our house I invited him inside. John said no thanks and proceeded to asked if I wanted to be his girlfriend. After months of waiting I shockingly said, “no” (I was perhaps a bit nervous and he told me he was moving to Portland) and immediately after I silenced his request with a smooch.
                </p> 
                <p>The rest from that moment is history… it includes: a last minute snowboarding trip to Colorado, my mother insisted on meeting him before she allowed her two daughters to go to Colorado with a “stranger”, a fantastic and impromptu trip to North Carolina, some years in Vietnam and Taiwan, living in SLC, and some amazing memories along the way. I never realized how much I would fall for John, I didn’t know how to be a “girlfriend” or what it felt like to say “I love you” but everything somehow fell into place.

                <h4>Their Story</h4>
               <p>On Thursday, October 19, 2017, John and Sarah were spending their last evening climbing, before 
                a short weekend trip to Florida starting the next day. 300 feet off the ground, John was just starting 
                the third pitch of a climb and was 10 feet out when he remembered he still had keys in his pocket. He starting 
                climbing back to Sarah so she could put them in the backpack. When Sarah reached out for the keys, she 
                was given a small wooden box instead, and was told "Don't drop it, it's important. You can open it 
                at the top of the next pitch." And with that, John started off again and waited for her at the top. 
            </p>
            <p> After what felt like forever, a shakened Sarah pulled over the last ledge to where
                a smirking John was waiting and asked if she still had the box. Once the box was back in 
                John's hands, he went down on one knee and gave the greatest speech the world had ever heard, 
                as it must have been, because she said yes to a lifetime of monogamy; and as they say, the rest is history!
