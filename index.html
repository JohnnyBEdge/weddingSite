            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p class="storyText">Sarah and John met while going to university together in Orlando, Florida.
                    Sarah was working at a rock climbing tower at the school's gym and John
                    was starting up his last year. After learning Sarah recently had returned from 
                    a trip to India and John also returning Vietnam, stories of traveling were shared, dates 
                    to their favorite restaurants were traded, and their passions of climbing and the outdoors were spent
                    together. Before they knew it, a year had passed, John had graduated, and with the support
                    of Sarah, decided to pursue his dreams of living abroad, back in Vietnam. It wasn't easy,
                    being apart for that long and with that much distance, but 8 months later, Sarah graduated
                     and joined him in teaching English, sciences, and Math. Three years and a another country
                     later, it was time for Sarah to pursue her dreams in Chemistry, so they left Asia for Utah
                      where Sarah is currently working on a PhD.
            </p>
            
            <p class="storyText"> On Thursday, October 19, 2017, John and Sarah were spending their last evening climbing, before 
                a short weekend trip to Florida starting the next day. 300 feet off the ground, John was just starting 
                the third pitch of a climb and was 10 feet out when he remembered he still had keys in his pocket. He starting 
                climbing back to Sarah so she could put them in the backpack. When Sarah reached out for the keys, she 
                was given a small wooden box instead, and was told "Don't drop it, it's important. You can open it 
                at the top of the next pitch." And with that, John started off again and waited for her at the top. 
            </p>

            <p class="storyText"> After what felt like forever, a shakened Sarah pulled over the last ledge to where
                a smirking John was waiting and asked if she still had the box. Once the box was back in 
                John's hands, he went down on one knee and gave the greatest speech the world had ever heard, 
                as it must have been, because she said yes to a lifetime of monogamy; and as they say, the rest is history!
